India accounts for the bulk of the Indian subcontinent, lying atop the Indian tectonic plate, and a part of the Indo-Australian Plate.India's 
defining geologic processes began approximately 70 million years ago, when the Indian Plate, then part of the southern supercontinent 
Gondwana, began a north-eastward drift caused by seafloor spreading to its south-west, and later, south and south-east.Simultaneously, 
the vast Tethyan oceanic crust, to its northeast, began to subduct under the Eurasian Plate.The Indian continental crust, however, was 
obstructed and was sheared horizontally. Its lower crust and mantle slid under, but the upper layer piled up in sheets (or nappes) ahead of the 
subduction zone.This created the orogeny, or process of mountain building, of the Himalayas. The middle and stiffer layer continued 
to push into Tibet, causing crustal thickening of the Tibetan Plateau. Immediately south of the emerging Himalayas, plate movement 
created a vast crescent-shaped trough that rapidly filled with river-borne sediment and now constitutes the Indo-Gangetic Plain.</p>

The Indian climate is strongly influenced by the Himalayas and the Thar Desert, both of which drive the economically and culturally 
pivotal summer and winter monsoons. The Himalayas prevent cold Central Asian katabatic winds from blowing in, keeping the bulk
 of the Indian subcontinent warmer than most locations at similar latitudes.The Thar Desert plays a crucial role in attracting the 
moisture-laden south-west summer monsoon winds that, between June and October, provide the majority of India's rainfall.</p>

India is a megadiverse country, a term employed for 17 countries that display high biological diversity and contain many species exclusively 
indigenous, or endemic, to them.India is the habitat for 8.6% of all mammals, 13.7% of bird species, 7.9% of reptile species, 6% of 
amphibian species, 12.2% of fish species, and 6.0% of all flowering plant species. Fully a third of Indian plant species are endemic.
 India also contains four of the world's 34 biodiversity hotspots, or regions that display significant habitat loss in the presence
 of high endemism</p>
