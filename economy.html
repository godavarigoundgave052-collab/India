<p style="color:blue; font-family:sans-serif; font-size:20;">According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Indian economy in 2024 was nominally worth $3.94 trillion; it is the fifth-largest
 economy by market exchange rates and, at around $15.0 trillion, the third-largest by purchasing power parity (PPP). With an average 
annual GDP growth rate of 5.8% over the past two decades, and reaching 6.1% during 2011–2012,India is one of the world's 
fastest-growing economies. However, it has a low per capita GDP, ranking 136th in the world in nominal terms and 125th adjusted for PPP.
The vast majority of Indians fall into the global low-income group based on average daily income</p>
